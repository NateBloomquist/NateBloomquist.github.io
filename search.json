    "section": "",
    "text": "For the past 14 seasons, the “Hit Man” Harrison Smith has been a dominant safety and franchise cornerstone for the Minnesota Vikings. Over his career, Smith has developed a reputation of being a cerebral and game-wrecking player. Aaron Rodgers, a future Hall of Fame quarterback and former Green Bay Packer who faced Smith twice a year for 11 seasons, has sang his praises about the safety, saying on the record that he is the most frustrating guy to play against due Smith being a “master of disguise” who is difficult to read and is absolutely a “Hall of Fame player” in his own right. However, even with all of his accolades and success, Smith has rarely been talked about by the media over his career. That brings up two questions, is Smith one of the best safeties of all time? If he is, then why does the media not talk about him?\nWhen it comes to the most important thing a Safety can do in the NFL, the vast majority of people would say it would be to make impact plays and create turnovers. Having the ability to give the ball back to your offense is often the difference in who wins versus who loses.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(nflplotR)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npbp &lt;- read_csv(\"pbp.csv\")\n\nsacks &lt;- pbp |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(sack_player_id), !is.na(sack_player_name)) |&gt;\n  left_join(load_rosters(1999:2024) |&gt; select(gsis_id, position), \n            by = c(\"sack_player_id\" = \"gsis_id\")) |&gt;\n  filter(position %in% c(\"S\", \"DB\", \"FS\", \"SS\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(sack_player_id, sack_player_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(sacks = n(), .groups = \"drop\") \n\nints &lt;- pbp |&gt;\n  filter(interception == 1, !is.na(interception_player_id), !is.na(interception_player_name)) |&gt;\n  left_join(load_rosters(1999:2024) |&gt; select(gsis_id, position), \n            by = c(\"interception_player_id\" = \"gsis_id\")) |&gt;\n  filter(position %in% c(\"S\", \"DB\", \"FS\", \"SS\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(interception_player_id, interception_player_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(interceptions = n(), .groups = \"drop\") \n\nsafety_stats &lt;- full_join(\n  sacks, \n  ints, \n  by = c(\"sack_player_name\" = \"interception_player_name\")\n) |&gt;\n  rename(player = sack_player_name) |&gt;\n  replace_na(list(sacks = 0, interceptions = 0)) |&gt;\n  filter(sacks &gt; 0 | interceptions &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  mutate(is_harrison = player == \"H.Smith\")\n\ntop_safeties &lt;- safety_stats |&gt;\n  mutate(total = sacks + interceptions) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total)) |&gt;\n  head(15)\n\nplot_data &lt;- top_safeties |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(sacks, interceptions), \n               names_to = \"stat\", \n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    stat = factor(stat, levels = c(\"sacks\", \"interceptions\"), \n                  labels = c(\"Sacks\", \"Interceptions\")),\n    player = reorder(player, -count)\n  )\n\nplot_data_butterfly &lt;- plot_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    count_signed = ifelse(stat == \"Sacks\", -count, count),\n    is_harrison = player == \"H.Smith\",\n    fill_color = case_when(\n      is_harrison & stat == \"Sacks\" ~ \"Harrison Sacks\",\n      is_harrison & stat == \"Interceptions\" ~ \"Harrison INTs\",\n      stat == \"Sacks\" ~ \"Other Sacks\",\n      stat == \"Interceptions\" ~ \"Other INTs\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(plot_data_butterfly, aes(x = player, y = count_signed, fill = fill_color)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Harrison Sacks\" = \"#4B0082\", \n      \"Harrison INTs\" = \"#FFA500\",\n      \"Other Sacks\" = \"gray50\", \n      \"Other INTs\" = \"#CCCCCC\"\n    ),\n    labels = c(\"Harrison Sacks\" = \"H.

While he may not be first in either sacks or interceptions, he is still third in sacks and fourth in interceptions. This disproves the idea that some people have that Smith is not a big play maker and is only a consistently good safety who gets the job done. While he may not put up crazy stats every year, he has been able to put up higher than average numbers for a longer than average career. But the question is how consistent has he been? As the saying goes, availability is the best ability, so how often has he been available to make the plays?\n\n\nCode\nsnaps &lt;- load_snap_counts(seasons = 2012:2024)\nsafety_snaps &lt;- snaps |&gt;\n  filter(position %in% c(\"S\", \"SS\", \"FS\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(player, season) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_snaps = sum(offense_snaps + defense_snaps + st_snaps),\n    defense_snaps = sum(defense_snaps),\n    defense_pct = mean(defense_pct),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(defense_snaps &gt;= 200)\n\nsmith_data &lt;- safety_snaps |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"Smith\", player))\n\n\ntop_safeties &lt;- safety_snaps |&gt;\n  group_by(player) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    career_snaps = sum(defense_snaps),\n    seasons = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(seasons &gt;= 3) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(career_snaps)) |&gt;\n  head(100) |&gt;\n  pull(player)\n\ncomparison_data &lt;- safety_snaps |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% c(smith_data$player, top_safeties)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    is_harrison = player == \"Harrison Smith\",\n    player_color = ifelse(is_harrison, \"Harrison Smith\", \"Other\")\n  )\n\naverage_data &lt;- comparison_data |&gt;\n  group_by(season) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_snaps = mean(defense_snaps), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(comparison_data, aes(x = season, y = defense_snaps, group = player)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = player_color, linewidth = is_harrison, alpha = is_harrison)) +\n  geom_line(data = average_data, aes(x = season, y = avg_snaps, group = 1),\n            color = \"red\", linewidth = 1.5, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(data = filter(comparison_data, is_harrison), \n             aes(color = player_color), size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Harrison Smith\" = \"#4F2683\", \"Other\" = \"gray70\"),\n                     breaks = \"Harrison Smith\") +\n  scale_linewidth_manual(values = c(0.5, 2), guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0.3, 1), guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2012, 2024, 2)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2023.5, y = max(average_data$avg_snaps) + 50, \n           label = \"Top 100 Average\", color = \"red\", size = 3.5, hjust = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Harrison Smith is the Definition of Consistency\",\n    subtitle = \"Top 100 Safetys Snap Count from 2012-2024\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Defensive Snaps\",\n    color = NULL,\n    caption = \"Data: nflreadr | Nate Bloomquist\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray50\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the real strengths of Harrison Smith is his consistency. Over his career, he has never had a “bad” year. He has always remained the one steady and consistent factor on the Vikings. While it isn’t the PFF ranking that would show a much more clear picture, the consistency of Smiths snaps alone speaks volumes. Since he entered the league in 2011, he has averaged more snaps than the average safety consistently over his entire career. 14 years of above average snaps is nearly unheard of. In a league as physical as the NFL where injuries are a common occurrence, Smith has somehow managed to, for the most part, avoid them.\n\n\nCode\nrosters &lt;- load_rosters(seasons = 1999:2024)\nplayer_stats &lt;- load_pfr_advstats(seasons = 2018:2024, stat_type = \"def\")\nstats_with_position &lt;- player_stats |&gt;\n  left_join(rosters |&gt; select(season, pfr_id, position, player_name = full_name),\n            by = c(\"season\", \"pfr_player_id\" = \"pfr_id\"),\n            relationship = \"many-to-many\")\nsafety_data &lt;- stats_with_position |&gt;\n  filter(position %in% c(\"S\", \"SS\", \"FS\", \"DB\"))\ntackle_cols &lt;- names(safety_data)[grepl(\"tackle|tkl|comb\", names(safety_data), ignore.case = TRUE)]\nsafety_tackles &lt;- stats_with_position |&gt;\n  filter(position %in% c(\"S\", \"SS\", \"FS\", \"DB\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(pfr_player_name, season) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    tackles = sum(def_tackles_combined),\n    missed_tackles = sum(def_missed_tackles),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(tackles &gt; 0)\nsmith_data &lt;- safety_tackles |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"Harrison Smith\", pfr_player_name))\ntop_safeties &lt;- safety_tackles |&gt;\n  group_by(pfr_player_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    career_tackles = sum(tackles),\n    seasons = n(),\n    avg_tackles = mean(tackles),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(seasons &gt;= 3) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(career_tackles)) |&gt;\n  head(30)\ncomparison_data &lt;- safety_tackles |&gt;\n  filter(pfr_player_name %in% c(smith_data$pfr_player_name, top_safeties$pfr_player_name)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    is_harrison = grepl(\"Harrison Smith\", pfr_player_name),\n    player_color = ifelse(is_harrison, \"Harrison Smith\", \"Other\")\n  )\nggplot(top_safeties, aes(x = reorder(pfr_player_name, career_tackles), \n                         y = career_tackles,\n                         fill = grepl(\"Harrison Smith\", pfr_player_name))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray70\", \"#4F2683\"), guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"They Call Him Hit Man For a Reason\",\n    subtitle = \"Top 30 NFL Safeties by Career Tackles (2018-2024)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Career Tackles\",\n    caption = \"Data: nflverse| Nate Bloomquist\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray50\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith his consistent snaps, Smith has also been able to put up consistent stats. While this data is only from 2018-2024, Smith still sits in the top 5 when it comes to tackles made by safeties. Far out of his prime, he is still able to perform at the same level of when he entered the league. The reason Harrison Smith has been able to build a hall of fame career is because of his consistency. While he may not put up 15 interceptions a year, he has been able to put up an impressive performance for 14 years."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past several years, sports betting has become a socially accepted practice while dynasties such as the Kansas City Chiefs have simultaneously dominated the NFL. Because of this, whenever a questionable penalty is called in favor of a dominant team, there have been outcries from fans complaining about officiating bias and unfair officiating. This begs the question, do the better teams in the NFL have an unfair advantage in games when it comes to officiating?\nWell, lets take a look at some data using the Chiefs as an example since they are the team who is mentioned the most in this discussion. nflverse has play-by-play data for each teams season dating back to 1999. To see if there is a bias towards certain teams, we can take the data starting in 2020 (when the Chiefs dynasty began) until present day and see if there is a discrepancy between the amount of penalties a team is getting versus the amount their opponents are getting.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(nflplotR)\nlibrary(nflverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npbp &lt;- load_pbp(2020:2024)\n\npenalty_data &lt;- pbp |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(penalty_team)) |&gt;\n  count(penalty_team, name = \"team_penalties\") |&gt;\n  rename(team = penalty_team) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    pbp |&gt;\n      filter(!is.na(penalty_team)) |&gt;\n      mutate(opponent = ifelse(penalty_team == posteam, defteam, posteam)) |&gt;\n      count(opponent, name = \"opp_penalties\") |&gt;\n      rename(team = opponent),\n    by = \"team\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(penalty_diff = opp_penalties - team_penalties)\n\nggplot(penalty_data, aes(y = reorder(team, penalty_diff))) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = team_penalties, xend = opp_penalties, yend = team), \n               color = \"gray\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = team_penalties), color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = opp_penalties), color = \"green\", size = 3) +\n  geom_nfl_logos(aes(team_abbr = team, x = (team_penalties + opp_penalties) / 2), \n                 width = 0.04, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_point(data = penalty_data |&gt; filter(team == \"KC\"),\n             aes(x = (team_penalties + opp_penalties) / 2),\n             shape = 21, size = 12, stroke = 2, color = \"blue\", fill = NA) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which NFL Teams Benefit Most from Penalties?\",\n    subtitle = \"Red = Team Penalties | Green = Opponent Penalties\",\n    x = \"Total Penalties\",\n    y = NULL,\n    caption = \"Data: nflverse 2020-2024| By Nate Bloomquist\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 11),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, color = \"gray\"),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the chart shows is that while the Chiefs commit less penalties than their opponents, it is not by a wide enough margin to say that they have an unfair advantage. Especially when teams such as the Falcons, the Vikings, and the Raiders all have a much larger difference.\nThe next logical argument would be what about the kind of penalty? When people are complaining about officiating regarding the Chiefs, it often has to do with soft roughing the passer calls or invisible pass interference penalties. We have all seen Patrick Mahomes flop or have an interception overturned due to a pass interference, so do they benefit from these types of high yardage calls more than other teams?\n\n\nCode\nhigh_impact &lt;- pbp |&gt;\n  filter(penalty_type %in% c(\"Roughing the Passer\", \"Defensive Pass Interference\")) |&gt;\n  select(posteam, defteam, penalty_type)\n\npenalty_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  high_impact |&gt; count(posteam, penalty_type, name = \"count\") |&gt; rename(team = posteam),\n  high_impact |&gt; count(defteam, penalty_type, name = \"count\") |&gt; rename(team = defteam) |&gt; mutate(count = -count)\n)\n\npenalty_data &lt;- penalty_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    team = factor(team, levels = penalty_data |&gt; group_by(team) |&gt; summarise(net = sum(count)) |&gt; arrange(net) |&gt; pull(team)),\n    penalty_display = ifelse(team == \"KC\", penalty_type, paste0(penalty_type, \" (Other)\"))\n  )\n\nggplot(penalty_data, aes(x = team, y = count, fill = penalty_display)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Roughing the Passer\" = \"yellow\",\n      \"Defensive Pass Interference\" = \"red\",\n      \"Roughing the Passer (Other)\" = \"gray70\",\n      \"Defensive Pass Interference (Other)\" = \"gray85\"\n    ),\n    name = \"Penalty Type\",\n    breaks = c(\"Roughing the Passer\", \"Defensive Pass Interference\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Do the Chiefs get the High Impact flags everyone complains about?\",\n    subtitle = \"Left = Penalties Committed, Right = Benefited from Opponent Penalties\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Number of Penalties\",\n    caption = \"Data: nflverse 2020-2024 | By Nate Bloomquist\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, the data seems to show the opposite of what most NFL fans would like to see. The Chiefs had less roughing the passer calls called against their opponents than a large amount of the league, which helps to disprove the rumor that referees give special treatment to Mahomes. Over the past 5 seasons, the Chiefs have also been one of the most penalized teams when it comes to defensive pass interference, which helps to further disprove that referees favor better teams.\nIf their opponents don’t get more penalties called against them and they don`t benefit from the penalties that most people complain about, the last argument that could be made would be when do those penalties happen.

However, the penalty advantage isn’t incredibly outrageous. Some may argue that even this slight advantage points towards an unfair advantage, but I view it differently. The way that I see it, the Chiefs are a very good team and if they are given an opportunity, such as a bad penalty call, they will take advantage of it.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the reason people believe that the Chiefs receive bias officiating from Referees is because they are a good team who is given more prime time games and media attention. With this increased attention, the bad calls that are prevalent around the entire NFL are put on full display."
